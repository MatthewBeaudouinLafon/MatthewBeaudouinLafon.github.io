											<h2>The Pitch (and Motivation)</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Picture this: you are at a conference having a network-inducing conversation with a collegue in your field. In typical networking fashion, you wish to exchange business cards to add theirs to your growing collection and vice versa. You may have done this exchange many times before, and as usual you shuffle trying to find your business cards, clumsily take two or three and offer one. You flash your best smile while internally swearing you'll be more prepared next time. Well using our (currently unnamed) product, you'll be more prepared than you could ever imagine.<br>
											Introducing: our business card dispenser. Simply hook it to your inside jacket-pocket and load it with a few business cards. When the crucial time comes, all you have to do is slide your fingers down your jacket and before you know it you are presenting your network ticket more smoothely than ever.
										</p>

										<p>
											Pitch aside, a team of four including myself are working on this product for the class at Olin appropriately called Products And Markets. The original idea was to stick our dispenser to the back of a tie, hooking it to the loop. We then realized that the inside jacket pocket would be less awkward and more gender neutral.

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The main idea behind Products And Markets (the class) is to find a product market fit. To do so, we had to do some research. At first we went into Babson College to interview a few business students. This gave us confidence that we had a market. More recently, we went into Boston to talk to businesses such as Brooks Brothers and Bull and Buck to learn about what type of accessory sells the most. In particular, we learned that our product would likely sell best as a gift. We have the option to either make a cheap product (plastic or aluminium fabrication), or focus on having something fancier, perhaps made out of leather.
											</p>

											<header>
												<h3>Prototypes</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												While doing our research, we made a few prototypes to gauge how exactly we wanted our product to work. We had the idea for how the interaction should be, the prototypes were to make that reality. <br>
												So we went down to Olin's machine shop, grabbed some scrap sheet metal and used a few fabrication techniques to get something quickly. We made what you see in the image above. The idea was then to attach a card holder to the front of the plate and shove a few business cards in there.
											</p>

												<div >Here, the prototype is worn on the back of a tie, but it could just as easily be hooked to a jacket's inside pocket. The opening for the cards is towards the floor, but the silicone's friction holds the cards in place.</div>
											</a> 

											<p>
												<br>
												This prototype worked quite well for 6 business cards, which wasn't as much as we hoped. We are now investigating other methods to hold the cards in place. <br>
												So stay tuned...
