											<h2>The Design Nature Play Project</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Design Nature is one of the first classes offered at Olin. One of the projects involves designing a play experience for fourth graders that is inspired by an animal.

											With three other people, we chose the Alligator because we had an idea for a themed Operation-type game, where one player would be a bird cleaning an alligator's mouth, which would shut if the bird's beak touched a tooth. Upon exploring the idea, we realized that the game would be more difficult to make than we imagined, and it did not really line up with design goals we had. After much brainstorming, we settled on this idea.

												<h3>Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The idea was to recreate the alligator's <a href="https://youtu.be/7KwYILC0yyc?t=1m11s">"Death Roll"</a>. We figured fourth graders would like to roll around. To do this, we imagined a scenario in which the metaphorical alligator attacks animals on in the center of the area, and rolls them into the water. One of our design goals was to make an intelligent game, so we made it such that 3 out of 9 prey we're "rotten". When retrieving the prey to the water, the player could chose to check whether the food is rotten or take a chance and "eat it". At the end of the game, healthy food would add one point to the player's score and rotten food would take one away.

											</a>

											<p>
												<br> When the day came to present our game to fourth graders, it became clear very quickly that doing on-the-fly cost-benefit analysis was perhaps asking a tad too much from the children. We still wanted the game to involve more than just rolling around, so we used each group of student as a test group for slightly different game mechanics. Sometimes have them look inside the [rey] , during the game, sometimes after, sometimes not at all.
											</p>

											<p>
												This was all around an interesting project. We didn't have a perfect team dynamic, which taught me a lot about how to make a team work towards a goal. In particular, we had an issue sticking to a single idea for a long time. We eventually realized that this was because we came up with ideas individually and tried to sell them to the rest of the team, leaving us attached to whatever we had come up with. We later scrapped all of them and tried coming up with what ended up being the final idea through a brainstorm session, leading all of us to feel close to that idea.
